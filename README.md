# Active Drag System (ADS)
This is the main codebase for Rocketry at Virginia Tech's Active Drag System, also known colloquially as the ADS, for the 2023-2024 competition year. It runs primarily on a BeagleBone Black, and its goal is to autonomously control the ADS' deployment during flight.

## BUILD
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cmake /vagrant
cmake --build .

## BUILD Alternative (Windows)
Enable WSL2 in windows
Install Ubuntu 22 LTS from Windows Store
```shell
sudo apt update && upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential cmake valgrind crossbuild-essential-armhf
```
Then to actually build:
```shell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build/
```

## RUN
scp -r src/ads debian@beaglebone.local:~/
ssh debian@beaglebone.local
./ads

## TEST
scp -r test/test_ads debian@beaglebone.local:~/
ssh debian@beaglebone.local
./test_ads

## GPIO Pins
The GPIO number is calculated by taking the GPIO chip
number, multiplying it by 32, and then adding the offset. For example,
GPIO1_12 = (1 Ã— 32) + 12 = GPIO 44.

```shell
/sys/class/gpio/gpio44 = GPIO1_12
```
